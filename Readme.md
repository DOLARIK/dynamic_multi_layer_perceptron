# Dynamic Multilayer Perceptron

I have designed a completely dynamic model of a Multilayer Perceptron in which we can give whatever shape we'd like to give an MLP. We can create a 1 Hidden Layer Model to a 1000 Hidden Layer Model to any Number of Hidden Layers we'd like the model to have in it just by tweaking some numbers. This frees us from adding a bunch of fresh lines of code every time we'd like to add just a single new layer in the model. It is easy and intuitive to use. It also occupies less space until the network architecture is decided.
